# Jupyter Notes in Python

Jupyter notes using VSCode as a local server can improve the learning process of the Python language; or the different topics that can be aproached with this language. 

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, very usefull, editing tool that has preinstalled Jupyter Notebooks, also integrated with GitHub.
